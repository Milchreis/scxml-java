scxml-java
==========

Java library that implements SCXML standard (http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml).

This implementation has only dependency with Apache JEXL to evaluate context expressions so it's easier to use with antoher frameworks as Android.

We will publish soon the android library which uses this one.
